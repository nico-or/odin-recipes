            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Sopaipillas are a typical Chilean dish. During the winter months you can found street stalls preparing them in every busy intersection. Since they're easy to make they too are a frequent home treat for the <em>once</em> (evening light meals).</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup of squash</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
                    <li>2 cups of white flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of milk or hot water</li>
                    <li>1 lt of oil for frying (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>First we need to cook and ground the squash. Cut the squash into roughly 1-inch cubes. Then place it in a pot and add enough cold water to cover the squash with a finger or two of water. Heat the water until it boils and leave it for about 15 minutes or until the squash is completely cooked. Then remove the skin and ground it with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Make a volcano with the flour, leaving a hole in the middle. Pour the melted butter, the milk or water, salt, the previously ground squash into the center. Mix everything to form a dough. Knead it until uniform, then leave it to rest 20 minutes for it to release the tension.</li>
                    <li>With a rolling pin spread the dought until 5mm thick, then cut it in 10cm circles. The size of the circle can be modified to taste. The thickness too, but making them too thick will make it hard to cook them evenly.</li>
                    <li>It is recommended to prick them with a fork before coocking them to avoid swelling.</li>
                    <li>Now you must choose a coocking method. Traditionally their fried in oil, but they can be made in the oven too for a more healthy and less messy alternative. </li>
                    <li>Frying: Heat the oil over high heat. Test the oil dropping a small piece of dought in it, it should start bubbling instantly and keep floating in the surface. Once the oil reaches a good temperature drop 1 to 3 sopaipillas (depending on the size of your pan, they should float freely without touching the sides or other sopaipillas) and fry them 1 minute per side. They should not brown too much. When done place them in a rack or paper towel for the excess oil to drip. Wait for the oil to gain temperature again and cook the next batch.</li>
                    <li>Oven: pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C. Place the sopaipillas in a lightly oiled oven tray leaving a 1cm or 1/2 inch gat between them (they might swell a little). Then put them inside the oven. Leave them for 15 minutes or until fully coocked.</li>
                    <li>Done! Now you can enjoy your sopaipillas. You can eat them alone, with sauces like green sauce, guacamole, mustard or ketchup.</li>
